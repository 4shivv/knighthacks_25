# D* Lite Path Planning Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
D* Lite incremental pathfinding has been successfully integrated into the backend server. The implementation provides efficient replanning when obstacles are discovered, enabling dynamic navigation for the ELEGOO Smart Robot Car.

## Components Created

### 1. **Pathfinding Module** (`pathfinding/`)
Complete D* Lite implementation adapted from [Dstar-lite-pathplanner](https://github.com/AtDinesh/Dstar-lite-pathplanner)

#### Files Created:
- **`pathfinding/__init__.py`** - Module initialization
- **`pathfinding/utils.py`** - Utility functions (Vertex, heuristic, grid/world coordinate conversion)
- **`pathfinding/priority_queue.py`** - Min-heap priority queue with lexicographic ordering
- **`pathfinding/occupancy_grid.py`** - 2D occupancy grid map (0=free, 255=obstacle)
- **`pathfinding/d_star_lite.py`** - Core D* Lite algorithm implementation

### 2. **Path Planning Loop** (`loops/path_planning_loop.py`)
- Runs at 1 Hz (every 1 second)
- Manages D* Lite lifecycle (initialization, replanning, goal updates)
- Converts between world coordinates (meters) and grid coordinates
- Updates next waypoint in state manager
- Monitors occupancy grid for changes and triggers replanning

### 3. **State Manager Updates**
Added pathfinding support:
- `update_next_waypoint()` - Sets next waypoint from path planner
- `target_object` property - Returns detected object matching mission objective
- Existing fields used:
  - `occupancy_grid` - 2D numpy array from sensor fusion
  - `next_waypoint` - Current target waypoint
  - `goal_position` - Final goal position

## D* Lite Algorithm Overview

### What is D* Lite?
D* Lite is an **incremental heuristic search algorithm** that:
- Efficiently finds shortest paths in grid maps
- **Incrementally replans** when edge costs change (new obstacles discovered)
- Only recomputes affected parts of the path (much faster than replanning from scratch)
- Used in robotics for dynamic environments

### Key Concepts:
1. **g[s]**: Cost estimate to reach goal from vertex s
2. **rhs[s]**: One-step lookahead value (best cost through neighbors)
3. **Priority Queue**: Processes vertices in optimal order
4. **k_m**: Accumulation factor for path cost updates

### How It Works:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with empty map (all cells free)
   - Compute initial shortest path from start to goal
2. **Execution**:
   - Robot moves along path
   - Sensors detect obstacles → update occupancy grid
3. **Replanning**:
   - Changed cells trigger replan
   - Only affected vertices are updated
   - New path is computed incrementally (fast!)

## Integration with Existing System

### Server Startup Sequence (Updated)
```
Step 1: Loading YOLO model...
Step 2: Initializing ADK Navigation Agent...
Step 3: Initializing shared state manager...
Step 4: Starting ADK session...
Step 5: Starting concurrent loops...
  ✓ Detection loop started (500ms interval)

  ✓ Path planning loop started (1000ms interval)  ← NEW

SERVER READY - Waiting for sensor input...
```

### Navigation Pipeline
```
1. Detection Loop (0.5 Hz)
   ↓ Detects target object

2. State Manager
   ↓ Sets target_object based on mission objective

3. Path Planning Loop (1 Hz)
   ↓ Initializes D* Lite with current position and target position
   ↓ Computes shortest path
   ↓ Updates occupancy grid from sensor fusion
   ↓ Replans if obstacles detected
   ↓ Gets next waypoint from path
   ↓ Updates state_manager.next_waypoint

4. Planning Loop (ADK Agent, 2 Hz)
   ↓ Reads next_waypoint from state manager
   ↓ Decides high-level action (MOVE_TO_WAYPOINT)
   ↓ Queues motor command

5. Motor Control Loop (0.3 Hz)
   ↓ Pops motor command from queue
   ↓ Translates to ELEGOO JSON format
   ↓ Sends to Arduino via WiFi
   ↓ Updates odometry

6. Loop back to step 3 (robot moved, replan if needed)
```

## Grid Configuration

### Default Settings:
- **Grid size**: 100x100 cells (10m x 10m world)
- **Resolution**: 0.1 meters per cell
- **Connectivity**: 8-connectivity (allows diagonal movement)
- **Coordinate system**:
  - World: (x, y) in meters, origin at robot start
  - Grid: (grid_x, grid_y) in cells, origin at (0, 0)

### Coordinate Conversion:
```python
# World to grid
grid_x = round(world_x / 0.1)
grid_y = round(world_y / 0.1)

# Grid to world
world_x = grid_x * 0.1
world_y = grid_y * 0.1
```

## API Endpoints (Updated)

### GET `/api/status`
Now includes path planning statistics:

{
  "loops": {
    "detection": {...},
    "planning": {...},
    "motor_control": {...},
    "path_planning": {                           ← NEW
      "running": true,
      "total_replans": 5,
      "total_obstacles_detected": 12,

      "has_goal": true,
      "current_path_length": 15,
      "grid_size": "100x100",
      "grid_resolution": "0.1m",

  },
  "state": {
    "next_waypoint": [1.2, 0.8],
    "path_status": "PATH_FOUND",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Usage Example

### Setting a Goal:
```python
# Detection loop finds target object
target = state_manager.target_object  # DetectedObject with position

# Path planning loop automatically:
# 1. Converts target position to grid coordinates
# 2. Initializes D* Lite with current position and target
# 3. Computes shortest path
# 4. Updates next_waypoint

# Planning loop (ADK) reads next_waypoint and generates motor commands
```

### Handling Obstacles:
```python
# Sensor fusion updates occupancy grid
state_manager.occupancy_grid = new_grid  # numpy array

# Path planning loop detects changes:
# 1. Compares old grid with new grid
# 2. Finds changed cells
# 3. Calls dstar.replan(current_pos, changed_cells)
# 4. Updates next_waypoint with new path
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
1. **Test Occupancy Grid**:
   ```python
   grid = OccupancyGrid(50, 50)
   grid.set_obstacle((10, 10))
   assert not grid.is_unoccupied((10, 10))
   ```

2. **Test D* Lite Pathfinding**:
   ```python
   dstar = DStarLite(grid, start=(0,0), goal=(10,10))
   dstar.compute_shortest_path()
   next_wp = dstar.get_next_waypoint((0,0))
   assert next_wp is not None
   ```

3. **Test Replanning**:
   ```python
   # Add obstacle on path
   grid.set_obstacle((5, 5))
   dstar.update_map([(5, 5)])
   new_path = dstar.get_full_path((0,0))
   assert (5, 5) not in new_path  # Path avoids obstacle
   ```

### Integration Tests
1. Start server and verify path planning loop starts
2. Set mission objective and verify target_object is set
3. Mock occupancy grid update and verify replanning occurs
4. Verify next_waypoint is updated in state manager

### Hardware Tests (Future)
1. **Static Obstacle Avoidance**: Place obstacle in path, verify robot replans
2. **Dynamic Obstacle**: Add obstacle after robot starts moving, verify replan
3. **Goal Reached**: Verify robot reaches goal and next_waypoint becomes None

## Next Steps

### Immediate (To Enable Path Planning)
1. **Implement Sensor Fusion** - Create `fusion/` directory:
   - `lidar_camera_alignment.py` - Align LiDAR depth with camera pixels
   - `occupancy_grid_generator.py` - Convert fused data to 2D occupancy grid
   - `fusion_loop.py` - Continuous sensor fusion (runs at 2 Hz)
   - Update `state_manager.occupancy_grid` from fusion loop

### Medium Priority
2. **Exploration Mode** - When target not visible:
   - Frontier-based exploration (find unexplored areas)
   - Generate waypoints to explore map
   - Integrate with D* Lite for navigation

3. **Path Smoothing** - Optimize path for differential drive:
   - Generate smooth curves instead of grid-aligned paths
   - Consider robot turning radius
   - Implement Pure Pursuit or Stanley controller

### Future Enhancements
4. **Dynamic Map Expansion** - Grow grid as robot explores
5. **Multi-Resolution Grid** - Coarse far away, fine nearby
6. **3D Pathfinding** - Use full 3D LiDAR point cloud

## Performance Characteristics

### Path Planning Loop (1 Hz):
- **Grid Size**: 100x100 = 10,000 cells
- **D* Lite Computation**: O(N log N) where N = changed vertices
- **Replanning**: Only affected vertices updated (typically <100 cells)
- **Memory**: ~40 KB for grid + ~200 KB for D* Lite state

### Expected Performance:
- **Initial Planning**: ~10-50ms for 100x100 grid
- **Replanning (few obstacles)**: ~5-20ms
- **Replanning (many obstacles)**: ~20-100ms
- **Loop overhead**: <5ms per iteration

## Summary
D* Lite pathfinding is **fully integrated** and ready for use once sensor fusion is implemented. The path planner will automatically:
- Find shortest paths to detected target objects
- Avoid obstacles discovered by sensors
- Replan efficiently when map changes
- Provide next waypoints to the planning loop

**Completion Status**: 5/5 components complete (100%) ✅
**Blocking Issue**: Sensor fusion needs to populate `state_manager.occupancy_grid`
